We’re about halfway through the 3rd annual Midwest Management Summit and I’ve updated last year’s PowerShell script to download this year’s session files. You can find the 2015 and 2016 scripts here: [https://github.com/AndrewJNet/CopyMMSFiles](https://github.com/AndrewJNet/CopyMMSFiles)

For now, most ASCII encoding isn’t getting converted in the scripts and I would like to combine these into a single module but they get the job done. If you’d like to contribute, please do a pull request on GitHub!
