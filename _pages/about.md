Just a guy raising a family in beautiful Northern Illinois. I currently work at my alma matter, Northern Illinois University and head up the SCCM environment in our central IT department along with providing support and design help with our Citrix and Office 365 environments. I love spending time with my family and friends, video games, and motorcycles.
